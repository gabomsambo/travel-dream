## Issue: Place Dialog Not Displaying Correctly After Enhanced Library Page Implementation

**Context**: Travel Dreams Collection app running in Docker at http://localhost:3000

**Problem**: The place details dialog in the library page doesn't match what the frontend expects from the backend after implementing the Enhanced Library Page feature.

**What Was Just Completed**:
1. ✅ Extended database schema with 3 new tables (attachments, place_links, reservations)
2. ✅ Added 11 new fields to places table (contact info, visit tracking, social)
3. ✅ Created API routes for file uploads, links, and reservations
4. ✅ Built new PlaceDetailsDialogEnhanced component with 6 tabs
5. ✅ Added Grid/List/Map views to library page
6. ✅ Fixed Leaflet integration and Docker build
7. ✅ App compiles and runs successfully

**Current State**:
- Docker running: `docker-compose ps` shows all services up
- Build successful: No TypeScript errors
- App accessible: http://localhost:3000
- ⚠️ Issue: Place dialog doesn't display new features correctly

**Your Task**:
Debug why the PlaceDetailsDialogEnhanced isn't showing the correct data structure.

**Read This First**:
```
/Users/gabrielsambo/Desktop/omot/travel-dreams/HANDOFF_PLACE_DIALOG_ISSUE.md
```

This document contains:
- Complete implementation details
- All file locations and line numbers
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Debugging steps to follow
- Type definitions
- API endpoint structure

**Key Files to Check**:

1. **Frontend Dialog**:
   - `src/components/places/place-details-dialog-enhanced.tsx`
   - `src/components/library/library-client.tsx` (lines 419-423)

2. **Backend API**:
   - `src/app/api/places/[id]/route.ts` (GET endpoint, lines 40-55)
   - `src/lib/db-queries.ts` (`getPlaceWithRelations`, lines 792-844)

3. **Types**:
   - `src/types/database.ts` (PlaceWithRelations interface)

**Quick Diagnostic Steps**:

1. Test API endpoint:
   ```bash
   # Get a place ID from database studio
   docker-compose exec travel-dreams npm run db:studio

   # Test API response
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/places/YOUR_PLACE_ID | jq
   ```

   Expected: JSON with place data + attachments/links/reservations arrays

2. Check browser console:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/library
   - Click a place card
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for errors or warnings

3. Check component props:
   - Add `console.log` in place-details-dialog-enhanced.tsx
   - Log what data is being received
   - Compare with PlaceWithRelations type

**Expected Dialog Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Place Name                    [X]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Overview] [Media] [Links]          │
│ [Bookings] [Planning] [Notes]       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tab Content Here                    │
│ (Shows place data, forms, etc.)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Common Issues to Check**:
- [ ] Is `getPlaceWithRelations()` returning all fields?
- [ ] Are the new table joins working correctly?
- [ ] Is the component using the correct import?
- [ ] Are props being passed correctly to tabs?
- [ ] Any TypeScript type mismatches?
- [ ] Is the migration applied? (Check db:studio)

**Environment**:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Drizzle ORM + Turso SQLite
- React 18
- Running in Docker
- All dependencies installed

**Useful Commands**:
```bash
# Logs
docker-compose logs -f travel-dreams

# Database
docker-compose exec travel-dreams npm run db:studio

# Shell
docker-compose exec travel-dreams sh

# Restart
docker-compose restart travel-dreams
```

**Success Criteria**:
✅ Dialog opens when clicking a place
✅ All 6 tabs visible (Overview, Media, Links, Bookings, Planning, Notes)
✅ Overview tab shows all place fields including new ones
✅ Other tabs show appropriate UI (upload forms, empty states, etc.)
✅ No console errors
✅ Data can be added/updated through the tabs

**Additional Context Files**:
- `PRPs/enhanced-library-page.md` - Original requirements
- `DOCKER.md` - Docker setup
- `AGENTS.md` - Project architecture
- `LEAFLET_COMPLETE_FIX.md` - Recent fixes applied

**Start Here**:
1. Read HANDOFF_PLACE_DIALOG_ISSUE.md thoroughly
2. Test the API endpoint response
3. Inspect the dialog component's data flow
4. Compare types and actual data
5. Fix any mismatches found

The app is in good shape - this is likely a small data structure mismatch between what the backend returns and what the frontend expects.
